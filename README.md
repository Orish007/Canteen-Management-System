The Online Canteen Ordering System is a responsive, full-stack web application built using Java, JSP, Servlets, JDBC, SQL, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, SMTP (JavaMail API),
and Razorpay API to digitalize food ordering in canteens. 
It allows users (Students, Teachers, or Guests) to log in, browse a dynamic menu, add multiple items to a cart, place secure online payments, and receive automated email confirmations. 
Designed to solve real-world problems like long queues, order mismanagement, and billing errors, 
it features a modern UI with dark/light mode, session tracking, and order history. 
Future goals include AI-based recommendations, inventory management, live order tracking, multi-canteen support, QR code ordering,
and analytics dashboards to enhance efficiency and user experience.

Full-stack implementation with responsive and modern UI.

Secure payment integration via Razorpay.
